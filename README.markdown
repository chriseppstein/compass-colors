Compass Colors
==============

This compass extension provides support for working with colors in Sass and generating color themes for use on your website.

Installing
==========

    sudo gem install compass-colors


To install a theme into your existing compass project, add the following to your compass configuration file:

    require 'compass-colors'

Then run this command:

    compass install colors/<Theme Name>

Where `<Theme Name>` is one of: `basic`, `complementary`, `triadic`, `split_complement`, `analogous`

Set your base color (before you import the theme file):

    $base_color: green   

The _theme.sass partial, using your declared `<$base_color>` can then be imported into your stylesheets,  and the color constants can be used.

    @import theme.sass
    
Using the Basic theme as an example, you will have access to color constants like these:

    $complement_support_color
    $complement_accent_color
    $dark_base_color
    
Supported Color Themes
======================

With all of these themes, you must pick a base color and the theme takes it from there:

* Basic/Monochromatic (basic)
* Complementary (complementary)
* Triadic (triadic)
* Split Complementary (split_complement)
* Analogous (analogous)
